* coding style
  - [X] use autopep8 on all file

* core [2/5]
  - [X] Refactor controller and generate random data:
        the only difference should be which data interface they are using:
        - [X] random or
        - [X] real arduino values
        - [X] > I can start with creating a common interface, which haves to
          be implemented by both arduino and random data classes
        - [X] > this will simplify a lot the code
        - [X] > Maybe i could use the configuration file
          to setup if we want fake data or real?
  - [X] Refactor get arduino data to reuse arduino/common interface
  - [ ] Refactor TemperatureInterface to force __enter__ and __exit__
  - [ ] Simplify TemperatureInterface usage, we should just have the function
        to get a new value; no need for request (blocking on read is fine)
  - [ ] main and generate_data should start webserver as well
* web [0/5]
  - [ ] responsive visualisation
  - [ ] jQuery mobile or equivalent for mobile
  - [ ] remove need for internet to load the website (local only should work)
  - [ ] favicon
* doc:
  - [ ] How to access website once setup is done
  - [ ] More detailed setup
  - [ ] Update README with changes
