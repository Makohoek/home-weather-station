* coding style
  - [x] use autopep8 on all file

* refactor
  - [ ] Refactor controller and generate random data:
        the only difference should be which data interface they are using:
        - random or
        - real arduino values
        -> I can start with creating a common interface, which haves to
          be implemented by both arduino and random data classes
        -> this will simplify a lot the code
        -> Maybe i could use the configuration file
          to setup if we want fake data or real?
  - [ ] Refactor get arduino data to reuse arduino/common interface
